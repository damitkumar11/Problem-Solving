"""Problem Statement:

Given two 2D arrays, row and column ranges,

Perform the following operations:

Find the matrix multiplication of the given two matrices and
Extract the elements from the output of above step using the given ranges
If matrix multiplication is not possible, return -1
Note: The end points (upper range) of both rows and columns are excluded.

Input Format:

There will be four lines of input as follows:  
First line will have mat1.  
Second line will have mat2.  
Third line will have two space-separated integers representing start and end point of rows.  
Fourth line will have two space-separated integers representing start and end point of columns.
Output Format:

A Numpy array
Sample Input:

[[6 6 4 7 9]  
 [0 2 2 9 3]  
 [6 0 2 5 2]  
 [2 4 3 5 5]]  
[[8 6 6 8 3]  
 [2 7 0 3 1]  
 [3 2 1 5 2]  
 [7 0 7 6 8]  
 [1 5 6 4 5]]  
1 3  
2 4
Sample Output:

[[83 82]  
 [85 96]]
Sample explanation:

The dimension of product is (5,5), and the elements for rows 1 to 4 and columns 2 to 4 are prd[1][2], prd[1][3], prd[2][2] and prd[2][3] i.e. 83, 82, 85 and 96. """

#Solution
import numpy as np
def specific_elements(mat1,mat2,r1,r2,c1,c2):
    '''mat1,mat2 are the two 2d numpy array.
       r1,r2 are the start and end of rows indices
       c1,c2 are the start and end of columns indices
       Output = Return a numpy array according to indices'''
    
    # STEP1 CHECK whether matrix multiplication is possible
    
    
    ## STEP 2 Perform matrix multiplication
    
    matmul_array = np.dot(mat1, mat2)
    
    ## STEP 3 slice the array based on range value
    
    result = matmul_array[r1:r2, c1:c2]
    
    return result
